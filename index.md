## Introduction

> The Xuborx Framework 2.0 is intended for creating web applications on PHP 7 or higher. It is developed by one person and does not position itself as something serious. This is not Laravel, Yii and Symphony. The advantage of Xuborx Framework 2.0 is that it is very simple. The framework will evolve as far as possible (or maybe not üòÅ). Whether to use it or not is up to you.
